My fellow citizens I stand here today humbled by the task before us grateful for the trust you have bestowed mindful now the sacrifice is borne by our ancestors I thank President Bush for his service to our nation as well as the generosity and cooperation he has shown throughout this transition 44 Americans have not taken the presidential oath the words have been spoken during rising tides of prosperity and the still waters of peace yet every so often the oath is taken amidst gathering clouds and raging storms and these moments America has carried on not simply because of the skill or vision of those in high office but because we the people have remained faithful to the ideals of our forebears and true to our founding documents so it has been so it must be with this generation of Americans.
