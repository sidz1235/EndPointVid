Hi, I'm Taylor.
Last time I was in a stadium this size I was dancing in heels and wearing a glittery leotard.
This outfit is much more comfortable.
I would like to say a huge thank you to NYU's Chairman of the Board of Trustees, Bill Berkeley and all the trustees and members of the board. NYU's President Andrew Hamilton, Provost Katherine Fleming and the faculty and alumni here today, who have made this day possible. 
I feel so proud to share this day with my fellow honorees Susan Hockfield and Félix Matos Rodríguez, who humble me with the ways they improve our world with their work.
